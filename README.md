R code for downloading and plotting satellite NO2 and H2CO data 
by Joel Wood

This is my R code for downloading satellite data from the Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (temis.nl). This is for a project I am currently working on with a former grad student lisa Shen on emissions trading and pollution hotspots in Ontario. i am currently only interested in 5-year averages over the 1998 to 2002 time period, so I only use the  GOME data; however, it would be very easy to alter the code to download and plot the current data. I am interested in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (H2CO), which combine (H2CO is a volatile organic compound) with intense sunlight to produce ground-level ozone.
